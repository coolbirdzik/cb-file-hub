CB File Hub is a cross-platform file manager focused on large personal media libraries. It is built for the situation where movies, photos, clips, and folders keep growing until finding the right thing to watch feels harder than watching it.

Instead of acting like a generic explorer, the app is designed to reduce browsing fatigue: faster visual scanning, tag-based organization, tabbed navigation on both desktop and mobile, network playback, and albums that can organize themselves with rules.

## Why This App Exists

This project started from a very personal problem: a movie and photo collection that became too large to browse comfortably. File names were not enough, folder trees became noisy, and searching for something to watch or review took too much effort.

CB File Hub focuses on solving that workflow with a media-first file manager that helps you browse visually, organize flexibly, and jump back into your library without losing context.

## Highlights

- **Media-first file management**: Browse local folders with layouts that work better for photos, videos, and mixed libraries than a plain file list.
- **Tabbed browsing on desktop and mobile**: Open multiple locations at once, switch contexts quickly, and keep parallel browsing flows alive on both Windows and Android.
- **Tag files and search by tags**: Add tags to files, reuse popular tags, and search with single or multiple tags to narrow a large library fast.
- **Smart albums with dynamic rules**: Build albums that automatically collect matching files from selected source folders using filename-based rules.
- **Choose the video thumbnail frame**: Control the extraction position used for video thumbnails so previews represent the part of the clip that actually matters.
- **Watch videos over SMB and FTP**: Open and stream media from network locations without turning your workflow into manual copy-paste.
- **Fast thumbnails for local and network media**: Generate thumbnails for images, videos, folders, and supported network files with caching to keep browsing responsive.
- **Pinned places and workspace memory**: Pin important folders in the sidebar and restore the last tab workspace with per-tab drawer state.
- **Built-in galleries for photos and videos**: Move from raw folder browsing into image and video focused views when you want to scan a collection visually.
- **Cross-platform foundation**: Built with Flutter and currently targeting Windows, Android, Linux, and macOS.
